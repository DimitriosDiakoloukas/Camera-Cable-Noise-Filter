# Camera-Cable-Noise-Filter


This repository contains a custom algorithm developed to filter out signal noise caused by camera cable interference in the ZED2i stereo camera, as used in a Formula Student Driverless Perception System.

In high-performance autonomous systems like Formula Student Driverless vehicles, signal integrity from vision sensors is critical. This implementation addresses noise artifacts introduced by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and other cable-related issues, enhancing the reliability of image streams for stereo vision and SLAM pipelines.

This repository also includes a python script that plots the GPU, CPU usage live and also the temperatures of the CPU and GPU which was used to debug the issue in several temperature and GPU or CPU consuption scenarios.
