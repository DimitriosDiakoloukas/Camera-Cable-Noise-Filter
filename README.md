# Camera-Cable-Noise-Filter


This repository contains a custom algorithm developed to filter out signal noise caused by camera cable interference in the ZED2i stereo camera, as used in a Formula Student Driverless Perception System.

In high-performance autonomous systems like Formula Student Driverless vehicles, signal integrity from vision sensors is critical. This implementation addresses noise artifacts introduced by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and other cable-related issues, enhancing the reliability of image streams for stereo vision and SLAM pipelines.
